To run example scripts, a LAMMPS executable is required. 


The folders contain
1) lj-diffusion: 
Input script for simulating Langevin dynamics of a LJ gas and outputting the mean-square displacement

2) polymer
Input script to simulate repuslve (self-avoiding) polymer chains in a box. Periodic boundary conditions can be set in Input script.
